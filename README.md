# Beef
## Brisket
* Slather in mustard
* Rub with a pepper-heavy hub
* Mostly have done them fat-side down but may be trying it up one time
* Moving more toward an Aaron Franklin style cook here - Cook at 275 with a water pan. Wrap at around 165 internal temp. 
Finish between 200 and 205 based on probe tenderness.

## Jerky
* Use flank steak, top/bottom round, eye of round - really any lean cut
* Marinade overnight (or longer).
* Trim as much fat off as possible. 
* Cut into 4in long and 1/4“ thick pieces before you place in marinade. 
* Smoke at 180 until done - I had started going 6hrs with it but recently backed off to around 4 because it was getting too crispy/hard.

## Jerky Marinade 
* For 3-5lbs meat
* 1 cup soy sauce
* 1 cup Worcestershire sauce
* 2 cups water
* 3/4 cup brown sugar
* 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper - I triple this, but preserving the original recipe for now
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 onion, cut into large chunks

## Keto Jerky Marinade (it's actually better!)
* For 3-5lbs meat
* 1 cup soy sauce
* 1 cup Worcestershire sauce
* 1 tablespoon Hickory Liquid Smoke
* 2 cups water
* 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
* 1 tablespoon paprika
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* 2 teaspoons black pepper
* 2 onion powder

# Pork
## Pulled Pork
No wrap, very heavy rub, cook to 200+, probably around 205
When heating, put in pan with a little oil, dust with rub, stir as you heat. As it’s getting hot add a little BBQ and 
keep stirring. Get it to where the pork is starting to crisp up.

* 270 for smoker temp
* Cook until probe tender - bag of butter
* 8hrs bare, 2hrs wrapped - Wrap when the fat cap splits, spritz with vinegar when wrapping
* Salt/pepper 50/50 and paprika for color

## Aaron Franklin Style Ribs
* 270 for smoker temp
* Full spare ribs
* 3hr open 3hr wrapped
* 2 or 3:1 pepper to salt rub with a bit of paprika
* Light slather of mustard
* Dilute sauce by half with vinegar for putting it on the cooker
* Sauce both sides after spritz then wrap

I love doing the ribs a bit hotter but think I want to add a step at the end to sauce. Thinking of trying a modified 
3-2-1, starting at 270, wrapping for 2hrs at more like 225, then saucing and finishing at 225. 

## Asian Style Char Sui Sticky Ribs
**Marinade**
* 2 1/2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
* 2 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar
* 3 tablespoons honey
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 2 cloves garlic minced
* 1/4 teaspoon Chinese five spice powder

**Glaze**
* 1/4 cup hoisin sauce
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 1 clove garlic minced
* 1/2 teaspoon Chinese
* 1/2 teaspoon red food coloring
* 1/4 teaspoons black pepper

**Instructions**
* Place rack of ribs, bone side down, onto a large piece of plastic wrap.
* Combine marinade ingredients in a small bowl and apply mixture evenly onto meat side of ribs.
* Secure ribs in plastic wrap and place into the refrigerator meat side down for 8-24 hours.
* Set smoker to 225 and cook for 4 hours.
* Combine glaze ingredients in a medium bowl. Start basting the last hour  of cook time.
* Baste several times on the meat side of the rack. Watch for burning.
* Cut into individual ribs and garnish with green onion and toasted sesame seeds. 

# Chicken 
## Wings
Smoking before crisping made for gummy skin. Try at a straight 350, maybe smoking after as an experiment


# Fish
## Basic Salted Salmon (Oldtime Fisherman style)
2.5-3lbs filet
4-5 handfuls of salt
Alder wood suggested
* Put fish on butcher paper to soak up moisture
* Cover fish in salt and refrigerate for 4hrs
* Rinse fish 10-12 times in cold water
* Pat dry and refrigerate uncovered overnight to help dry
* Cut into 4 pieces and put in smoker
* Smoke at lowest heat possible and remove at 145 degrees
* If cold smoking, can go up to 12hrs - start checking at 8hrs by pressing down on the fish - it should have just a 
  little give when done. If too soft, keep smoking

# Other

## Pepperoni
8hrs @ 165 (or as low as you can get it)

## Aaron Franklin Style BBQ Sauce
* 2 tbsp fat (any kind of fat or oil - beef fat is probably best)
* 1/3 large yellow or white onion chopped
* 4 cloves garlic chopped
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 1.5 cup apple cider vinegar
* 2 cups ketchup
* 2 tsp smoked paprika 
* 1 tsp mustard powder
* 1 tsp fine sea salt
* 1 tsp black pepper
* Several dashes Worcestershire 


## Cuban Sandwiches
* Mostly have used ciabatta rolls but other breads may work
* Pulled pork (smoked of course)
* Ham
* Pickles
* Swiss cheese
* Mayonnaise
* Mustard

Spread mayo on rolls and toast. Add mustard then a slice of cheese on each half of the roll. Layer pickles on the top 
half of the bun covering the whole bun. Heat up ham and pork and brown it a little. Put down the pulled pork on the 
bottom half of the bun and add some more mustard on that. Add another piece of swiss cheese and the ham. Put the 
sandwich together and into a pan heated to low-med heat. Squish well and toast both sides. Consume.
