*Pepperoni*
8hrs @ 165
*Brisket*
Definitely use a water pan
Pretty good doing 225 overnight, no wrap, water pan, then wrapping at 180* until 200*
May separate point before smoking
*Jerky*

* Use flank steak, top/bottom round, eye of round - really any lean cut
* Marinade overnight (or longer).
* Trim as much fat off as possible. 
* Cut into 4in long and 1/4“ thick pieces before you place in marinade. 
* Smoke at 180 until done - I like to go until all the red has faded to a dark brown/black color. This might be considered overdone but I like it almost crispy. 6-8hrs seems about right. 

*Jerky Marinade (for 3-5lbs meat)*

* 1 cup soy sauce
* 1 cup Worcestershire sauce
* 2 cups water
* 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 onion, cut into large chunks

*Wings*
Smoking before crisping made for gummy skin. Try at a straight 350, maybe smoking after as an experiment

*Aaron Franklin’s Pulled Pork*
No wrap, very heavy rub, cook to 200+, probably around 205
When heating, put in pan with a little oil, dust with rub, stir as you heat. As it’s getting hot add a little BBQ and keep stirring. Get it to where the pork is starting to crisp up.

* 270 for smoker temp
* Cook until probe tender - bag of butter
* 8hrs bare, 2hrs wrapped - Wrap when the fat cap splits, spritz with vinegar when wrapping
* Salt/pepper 50/50 and paprika for color


*Aaron Franklin’s Ribs*

* Full spare ribs

* Sauce both sides after spritz then wrap
